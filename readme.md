## Memorandum iOS Application

Memorandum is an iOS project developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

### Key Features:
- **MVC Architecture:** The application separates responsibilities using the MVC pattern. Classes in the "Model" folder manage application data, which is then passed to various View Controllers (one for each screen) for handling, and finally to Views defined in storyboards to visually represent the data.

- **Navigation Controller:** Utilizes a navigation controller to facilitate seamless navigation between screens. The back button in the top right corner ensures easy navigation back to the main view.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, leveraging constraints for each graphical element. This ensures usability across devices of varying screen sizes.

- **Table Views:** Uses Table Views to display data in a structured and user-friendly manner.

This project showcases best practices in iOS development, emphasizing clean architecture and intuitive user interfaces.
